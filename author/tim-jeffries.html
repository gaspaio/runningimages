</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>Ryan Hall is the fastest marathon runner in American history. His consistency is only matched by legends of the sport. In order to go down as the best, however, Ryan needs to do something that has eluded him his whole career - win an international marathon.</p>
<p>This August, Ryan will try to do that in the biggest race of his life, the 2012 Olympic Marathon. He will take on the dominant east Africans and the rest of the world in a race that is being billed as the toughest and fastest in Olympic history.</p>
<p>Ryan isn't the ordinary runner, though. While competitors prepare in training groups under the systematic care of coaches and advisors, Ryan runs alone. Practicing what he calls faith-based coaching, he relies exclusively on the direction of his faith to dictate his training, an unprecedented and often scrutinized approach in the world of distance running. &quot;For me, running is an art more than a science,&quot; says Ryan. One can't argue with his results up to this point, but will his faith be enough to take him to the top?</p>
<p>This film will tell his story.</p>
