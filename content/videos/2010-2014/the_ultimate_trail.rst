In September 2013, Philippe and Anna Gatta left the small village of Simikot in the Western Nepal, aiming to run the high route of the Great Himalaya Trail in less than 40 days. Running the High Route in less than 40 days is the equivalent of 40 marathons in 40 days with 15 passes over 5,000 meters and two over 6,000m. This film tells their story.
