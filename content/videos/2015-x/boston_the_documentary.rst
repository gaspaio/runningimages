From its humble origins 120 years ago to present day, Boston immerses the viewer into the wondrous kaleidoscope of the oldest annually contested marathon in the world.

Evolving from a workingman s challenge to welcoming foreign athletes and eventually women, the iconic race paved the way for the modern marathon and mass participatory sports.

Narrated by Academy AwardÂ® winner Matt Damon, Boston features many of running s greatest champions including Shalane Flanagan, Meb Keflezighi, Bill Rodgers, Frank Shorter and Joan Benoit Samuelson.
