The documentary is about the pursuit of finding the limit in running. 
The concept seems almost too simple for the last-man-standing race, where runners have an hour to complete a 4.166667-mile trail loop during the day and a road loop at night. The loops repeat until there is one runner left, so having a plan of not quitting almost guarantees a victory.
