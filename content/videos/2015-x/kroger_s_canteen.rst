In 2014, Kilian Jornet won the Hard Rock 100 mile run through the San Juan’s of Colorado.  Along the way he stopped at Kroger’s Canteen – an aid station perched on a tiny ledge, 13,100ft above sea level.  
This is a story about that aid station, about the people that make it happen, and about the spirit one can only find at The Hard Rock 100.
