When he was a child Kilian Jornet, the world's greatest ever mountain runner, made a list of all the races he wanted to win and all the mountains he dreamt of climbing.  The documentary tells the story of how Kilian Jornet, the world's greatest ever mountain runner, succeeded in completing the historic double ascent of Everest in one week, alone and without oxygen in May 2017.
