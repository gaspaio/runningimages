After watching endless documentaries about elites running Western States, it’s nice to watch the “average joes” getting it done. I stumbled upon this one while falling down the rabbit hole of YouTube, and I just loved it.  Not only is the soundtrack awesome, but Paul Braa’s enthusiasm about finally making it to the race of his dreams is contagious.
