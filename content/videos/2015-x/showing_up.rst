The documentary film will take you in-depth into the lives of 8 athletes who collectively tell the story of community, identity, and why it matters to be a part of something transformative. November Project, the Free Fitness Movement that started in Boston that is now taking over the world, is simply the vessel for these stories. Laugh, cry, train, support, repeat. Please view, share, and talk to strangers out there in the world.
