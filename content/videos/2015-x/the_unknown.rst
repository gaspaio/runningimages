"You really have to embrace the unknown. You can try all you want to script it - how you see the day going and have these plans. But the mountains don't care. They're indifferent to whatever plans, whatever hopes you have..."
The 2016 Hardrock 100 was supposed to be a redemption race. In 2014, The North Face athlete Timothy Olson hit a figurative brick wall halfway through The Hardrock and was reduced to lying on the ground, sick and unable to continue for awhile. He eventually finished but wanted to prove to himself he could do better. He got that opportunity in 2016 when he was selected to run the race again. 
Unfortunately for Timothy, deja vu would rear its ugly head and a similar fate awaited him at the Hardrock...
