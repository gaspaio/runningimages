&lt;dt&gt;&amp;quot;The Struggle Ends When the Gratitude Begins&amp;quot;&lt;/dt&gt;

&lt;div class="line"&gt;a quote Obstacle Course Racing Champion Amelia Boone leaned on when at the zenith of her endurance career in 2016, a stress fracture in her femur would sideline her for the next two years. Fast forward to February 3, 2018 as she toed the line of her first ultramarathon back at the Sean O'Brien 100K, Amelia reflects back on being injured and her newfound gratitude and perspective on running.&lt;/div&gt;

</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Arguably the greatest American ultrarunner of all time, Ann Trason won an unprecedented 14 times at the Western States 100 Mile Endurance Run while winning and setting course records at many other ultra races. But instead of embracing her incredible feats,  particularly in the 80-90's, a naturally introverted and modest Ann prefers to discuss the joy she feels on the trails and &amp;quot;competing with herself&amp;quot; versus those that toed the line with her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this 3rd edition of &amp;quot;15 Hours&amp;quot; we follow the great Ann Trason on a day spent camping in the mountains of Bishop hiking in the High Sierras along with her dog. She opens up and shares her thoughts about her competitive years, why she shies away from the spotlight, her love of Western States and her thoughts on her portrayal in the best selling book &amp;quot;Born to Run&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

The concept seems almost too simple for the last-man-standing race, where runners have an hour to complete a 4.166667-mile trail loop during the day and a road loop at night. The loops repeat until there is one runner left, so having a plan of not quitting almost guarantees a victory.&lt;/p&gt;

</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today, all anybody needs to run is the determination and a pair of the right shoes. But just fifty years ago, running was viewed almost exclusively as the domain of elite male athletes who competed on tracks. With insight and propulsive energy, director Pierre Morath traces running&amp;amp;#xFFFD;&amp;amp;#x6EA;s rise to the 1960s, examining how the liberation movements and newfound sense of personal freedom that defined the era took the sport out of the stadiums and onto the streets, and how legends like Steve Prefontaine, Fred Lebow, and Kathrine Switzer redefined running as a populist phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;

</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Western States 100-Mile Endurance Run is the world’s oldest 100-mile trail race. Starting in Olympic Valley, California it ends 100.2 miles later in Auburn, California. Western States draws the top ultrarunners in the world, who can finish the race in under 15 hours. But perhaps the race’s most exhilarating finishes happen in double that time, as everyday people try to finish under the 30-hour time cutoff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Known as the Golden Hour, the final hour of the race is a celebration of persistence, courage, and grit. It is what 7-time Western States top-10 finisher Andy Jones-Wilkins calls &amp;quot;the best hour in ultrarunning.&amp;quot; It is an hour that defines the sport.&lt;/p&gt;

</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When it comes to world-class marathon runners, Kenyans are considered the cream of the crop. But some of Kenya's top runners aren't running for fame and fortune. Some are wanted warriors, running for their lives. For years, Julius Arile and Robert Matanda thrived among the bands of warriors that terrorize the North Kenyan countryside. Stealing cattle, raiding and running from the police is the only life they knew. So when both warriors suddenly disappeared from the bush, many assumed they were dead or had been arrested. Instead, they traded in their rifles for sneakers in the hopes of making it big as professional marathon runners. Years of fleeing from the police have prepared the men for running marathon distances, but do they have what it takes to overcome the corruption, mistrust and jealousy that threaten to derail their careers? Told entirely by its central characters, Gun Runners is the American Dream, Kenyan-style.&lt;/p&gt;

</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In September 2017, I stepped up to the starting line of the Run Rabbit Run 100 in Steamboat Springs, Colorado, alongside my friend Jayson Sime. The race is a 102.9-mile ultramarathon with 20,000 feet of elevation gain, which is no small feat for a couple of guys who don’t know what they’re doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jayson had talked me into it, and if I were to be completely honest, I’d say we were there to test out his life philosophy, which is basically that you can do anything you dream up, as long as you put in the work and refuse to quit. That ethic has worked for him in almost every other area of life, despite growing up in poverty, one of six children with no father, and dyslexia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the six months leading up to the race, we figured since we weren’t naturally talented runners, the best thing we could do is work hard. So we ran 50- to 70-mile weeks all summer, and went through a full range of feelings: fear, regret, sadness, FOMO, hunger, thirst, exhaustion, pain, and joy. And gluttony, which is not a feeling, but what happens after you run 20 or more miles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How did the race go? You can watch our film, How to Run 100 Miles, to find out. No spoilers here.&lt;/p&gt;

For this to happen, he tries to broaden his horizons with a new trail or destination every time. After completing the GR20, little were the options to top it off. Then came the idea of the John Muir Trail or JMT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JMT presents many challenges: its distamce, the isolation and the altitude, to name only a few,make it one of the most beautiful trail in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attempting to run 350km of single trail crossing the isolated and mystic mountains of the Sierra Nevada is no small feat. Do it in a single shot and that's what legends are made of.&lt;/p&gt;

At the summit of Bear Peak, a giant boulder became dislodged sending Mackey tumbling down the mountain before it also landed on him crushing his left leg. After a series of unsuccessful surgeries over the next year plus to get back to normal, he and his family made the difficult decision to amputate. This is his story about perseverance and coming back from the injury to attempting to complete the Leadville Race Series to become the first ever leg amputee to call himself a &amp;quot;Leadman&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

Originaire d’un village de montagne dans une zone reculée du Népal, Mira a toujours rêvé d’être une grande sportive malgré les difficultés auxquelles, comme toutes les Népalaises, elle est confrontée. Après avoir quitté ses parents et rejoint les rangs de l’armée maoïste jusqu’à la fin de son adolescence, Mira a ensuite tenté de percer dans le sport en ralliant la lointaine Katmandou. A court d’argent et sur le point de rentrer chez elle, au cours d’un entrainement matinal elle tombe sur un coureur qui lui parle d’une course dans les collines avoisinantes. Mira la remporte et réalise que la rudesse de son enfance dans les montagnes l’a préparée à exceller dans cette discipline.
Cette histoire filmée au Népal, à Hong Kong, en Australie, en Espagne en Italie raconte le parcourt de Mira, prête à tout pour concourir face aux meilleurs coureurs d’ultra-trail du monde.&lt;/p&gt;

</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Barkley Marathons - one of the world's toughest ultramarathons, has been held annually in the Frozen Head State Park, Tennessee, since 1987.
The race is so brutal that, since the inception of the race, only 15 people have managed to finish. Runners are to run five 20-mile loops, within a 60 hour time limit and with more than 20.000m of elevation change.
The course is unmarked, no electronic devices are allowed and most of the race is off-trail.
Out There - A journey to the Barkley Marathons is the story of Belgian ultrarunner Karel Sabbe, who holds the world records on two of the most epic trails in the world: the 4279km long Pacific Crest Trail and the 3500km long Appalachian Trail.
How did setting these world records prepare Karel for a race as brutal as &amp;quot;the Barkley&amp;quot;? How did these adventures help Karel to find the necessary mindset to do well at this Spartan challenge?
Out There is a story of persistence, endurance and a passion for the great outdoors, and the film inspires the audience to reconnect with nature and to find courage for personal challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

His goal was to try and beat the record time of 6 days 13 hours and 1 minute, set five years earlier by fellow fell runner Steve Birkinshaw.
Needing to cover a distance of approximately 318 miles and ascend the equivalent height of four times Mt Everest, Paul knew this was his biggest challenge to date and enlisted the help of friends and family.
Battling sleep deprivation and everything the Lake District weather could throw at him, what transpired was a story that gripped not only the fell-running and ultra-running communities but also the wider sporting world.&lt;/p&gt;

</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Skid Row Marathon is the uplifting and inspiring story of an unlikely group of individuals from LA's Skid Row, who receive a second chance at life, all brought on by a simple act of kindness.
Follow the story of High Court Judge, Craig Mitchell as he coaches a long-distance running club from the Midnight Mission on Skid Row. Using the redemptive power of running and the camaraderie of the group, marathon training raises the spirits of Skid Row's inhabitants and gives a sense of purpose to a group of people who are homeless, addicted or coming out of the prison system.
&amp;quot;One horrendous act does not define a person in his entirety&amp;quot; and so the film highlights the transformation of homeless and often helpless individuals into sober, rounded and functioning members of society.&lt;/p&gt;

In order to go down as the best, however, Ryan needs to do something that has eluded him his whole career - win an international marathon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This August, Ryan will try to do that in the biggest race of his life, the 2012 Olympic Marathon. He will take on the dominant east Africans and the rest of the world in a race that is being billed as the toughest and fastest in Olympic history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ryan isn't the ordinary runner, though. While competitors prepare in training groups under the systematic care of coaches and advisors, Ryan runs alone. Practicing what he calls faith-based coaching, he relies exclusively on the direction of his faith to dictate his training, an unprecedented and often scrutinized approach in the world of distance running. &amp;quot;For me, running is an art more than a science,&amp;quot; says Ryan. One can't argue with his results up to this point, but will his faith be enough to take him to the top?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This film will tell his story.&lt;/p&gt;

</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;[Runner's World] Everyone has a reason for why they run, and this film shares a handful of those stories in inspiring fashion. The documentary spotlights six runners over the age of 50—including a father attempting his very first 5K with his autistic son by his side, running revolutionary Kathrine Switzer, and an 80-year-old running a half marathon in celebration of her birthday—as they train for a monumental race. If you need a reminder that you can accomplish any goal you set your mind to, no matter your age or experience, this is one to watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[official] THE HUMAN RACE is an inspirational full-length documentary about six runners, all over the age of 50, as they each train for the biggest race of their lives. These six athletes cover quite the spectrum: from a father attempting his very first 5K - with his autistic son by his side, to beloved running icon Kathrine Switzer who, in 1967, became the first woman to officially run the Boston Marathon as a numbered entry, to an 80-year-old running a half-marathon in celebration of her birthday, to a cancer survivor's attempt to run across all fifty states. We'll find out what motivates them to keep going, we'll delve deeply into their various training programs, and we'll follow them all the way to the finish line - while getting to know their colorful personalities and gaining insight on how running has helped them through various struggles. Make no mistake, this documentary is not &amp;quot;cute.&amp;quot; These runners are dedicated, fierce, competitive...and they could probably outrun you.&lt;/p&gt;

In 2014, The North Face athlete Timothy Olson hit a figurative brick wall halfway through The Hardrock and was reduced to lying on the ground, sick and unable to continue for awhile. He eventually finished but wanted to prove to himself he could do better. He got that opportunity in 2016 when he was selected to run the race again.
Unfortunately for Timothy, deja vu would rear its ugly head and a similar fate awaited him at the Hardrock...&lt;/p&gt;

</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Why do we run 100 miles?
It's a question I get from friends and acquaintances quite often. And in the lower moments during these ultramarathon events if I'm honest, a question I direct inward too. Sure, on the surface you can cite self-improvement, challenging yourself, so on and so forth. But the longer I do this, the more I started to explore answers beyond the surface. How we relate to discomfort, uncertainty and pain. Do we have it too easy and thus, we're drawn to the opposite end of the spectrum where we're reduced to &amp;quot;survival&amp;quot; mode and drinking/eating/moving forward? Are we in our more natural state when this is what our world is reduced down to?
Using the historic and legendary Leadville 100 Mile Race as my backdrop and with the support of GU Energy Labs, I explore these ideas as I ran my 3rd 100-mile race at the &amp;quot;Race Across the Sky&amp;quot;. Through the good, bad and the ugly - I attempted to unpack &amp;quot;the why&amp;quot; in running a 100 miles. My thanks again to them for the support!&lt;/p&gt;

In the midst of the 2016 National Elections, which saw Republican candidate Donald Trump win the presidential elections, Gates realised that the America he knew wasn’t necessarily the America that was. Intrigued and curious, Gates decides to head out and see for himself in order to try understand and empathise with his fellow Americans. Starting out on the edge of the Atlantic Ocean in South Carolina, Gates journey takes him 5 months and nearly 3700 Miles to the Pacific Ocean in San Francisco, California. What begins as a search for the true America, during a period of political turmoil, ultimately becomes a story of identity as Gates begins to find clarity and meaning in his own life.&lt;/p&gt;

</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On July 1st, 2015, Gary Robbins - a seasoned and winning ultrarunner - started at Longmire, in the shadow of Mount Rainier, and attempted to set the fastest known supported time around the Wonderland Trail. Kyle Skaggs' record of 20 hours 53 minutes was always considered unbeatable. 93 miles, over 24,000ft of elevation gain, and record breaking heat. This day had it all. Could Gary step up to the challenge?&lt;/p&gt;

After being honorably discharged from the Air Force and dealing with bouts of severe depression, Walmsley turned to running to get his life back on track. He moved to Flagstaff, Arizona, and connected with a community of runners who helped him rebound and supported him after his infamous wrong turn at mile 93 of the 2016 Western States 100 race.&lt;/p&gt;
